IEM HACKATHON REPOSITORY APP INSTRUCTION 


-------------------------------
----------INSTRUCTION----------
-------------------------------

1. Click the Alert AP app from your home screen.
2. An Integrated Google Map will appear which will be used to navigate your current location and your desired location.
3. You can either - 
  a. Select the navigation button to find your current location.
           or,             
  b. Type a specific address to find your desired location.
4. After accepting the input from you the app will show some of the important parameters of air which may suggest you the air quality of your surroundings.

-------------------------------

The quality of the air is divided into 7 Classes in our app. Those are-
    1. Healthy.
    2. Moderately Polluted. 
    3. Bit Unhealthy.
    4. Unhealthy.
    5. Very Unhealthy.
    7. Hazardous.

-------------------------------

5. Except this feature, we also have a push notification system integrated on our app which will continuously notify you about the air quality in an interval of 3 hours. 

-------------------------------

The Backend of the app :-

1. Uses Google Maps API and Locations API to get the location.
2. Uses a Php script and firebase messaging service to send notifications.
3. Uses AQUICN API for collecting the parameters of the air.

-------------------------------

How It can help :

1. Let us assume our app user is a tourist he/she wants to visit Delhi but don't know the current air quality of Delhi which goes worse in winter. Our app is one stop solution for him/her.
2. You can take precaution if you want to go outside on a polluted day when the important parameters of air cross the limits.
3. It is a one spot destination to get the pollution data as well as a weather report as provided by the nearest weather station.
