We are at a priviledge of selecting  problem statement 4 of IEM-ISSAC.
The problem deals with one of the current weather challenges -air pollution and its adverse affects.
Due to high levels of air pollution, nowadays people are suffering from various respiratory diseases.

In this scenario, We aim to design an application called "Alert AP" - Be Aware of the Air You BREATHE.

---------------------------------------

The functionalities of the app can be summarised as:

1. Sends a notification alert every 3 hours to the user.
2. If the user clicks on the notification the app will be launched.
3. In the main screen there will be provision of a Google map.
4. The names of primary air pollutants are mentioned (For example PM2.5,N2O etc). The user can select the pollutnt(s) the concentration of which he/she wants to find out. 
5. If the user clicks on any of them the app will show the concentration of that particular pollutant(in ppm) in his/her current neighbourhood or any other locality one choses in the google map within a range of 300m. This will be shown in the lower half of the screen.This is done with the help of AQUICN.
6. We will also provide a notification updated every three hours that can alert the user about the current conditions and warn them about further degradation of air quality.
